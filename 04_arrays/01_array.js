/**
 * In contrast to variables, an array can store multiple values.
 * Each value in an array has an index, and each index has a reference in a memory address.
 * Each value can be accessed by using their indexes.
 * The index of an array starts from zero, and the index of the last element is less by one from the length of the array.

// Using Array constructor
// syntax
const arr = Array()
// or
// let arr = new Array()
console.log(arr) // []

// Using square brackets([])
// syntax
// This the most recommended way to create an empty list
const arr1 = []
console.log(arr1)
